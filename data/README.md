### Objective 
This repository is mainly about Course Stats 159 at UC Berkeley, fall 2016 - second project. This project follows the ideas presented chapter 6: _Linear Model Selection and Regularization_ (from "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James et al) and performs a predictive modeling process applied on the data set `Credit`. We will carry out results and comparison between different predictive models and details the project in report paper.
